Works best with Python 3.9

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all necessary packages.

See REQUIREMENTS.txt for list of those packages.

Online Jupyter notebooks for people with no experience setting up enviroments with packages is suggested.

## Usage
Script 1 isn't mandatory for the process but gives a good insight through visual maps. Can be run for any location visible in OpenStreetMaps.
Run script 2, 3, 4 and 5 in order to find best nodes for a MIEV HUB in given place
Script 6 and 7 can be used individually for every location in order to get information in terms of Point of Interests and Population data.
